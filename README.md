# Cycling races countdown Twitter Bot

This is a simple Twitter bot that tweets days until the next races on the calendar.


Note this is an early version and a lot is still to do. Very very experimental and unclean code.
Any help is usefull.

### TODO:
- [x] Tweet days left until races within one month
- [x] Tweet the weather during race days
- [ ] Answer how many days to a certain race if someone tweets us with the hashtag of the race.


### RUN
```
$ git clone https://github.com/Renato-Silva/cycling_countdown
$ cd cycling_countdown
$ npm install
$ cp config.json config.production.json
$ npm start
```
